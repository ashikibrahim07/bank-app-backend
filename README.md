# Book App Backend ðŸ“š

This is the backend of the **Online Book Store** project. It's built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose** for data storage.

## Demo

The backend can be tested with the frontend at [Book App Frontend Demo](https://online-book-store-frontend-beta.vercel.app/). The backend API endpoints are consumed by the frontend.

## Features

- Handle CRUD operations for books (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Handle user authentication and authorization.
- Store book details such as title, author, genre, and description.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the server.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to handle routing.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to store books and user data.
- **Mongoose**: Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
- **JWT**: For secure authentication of users.
- **Bcrypt**: For hashing passwords.
- **CORS**: Used to enable cross-origin requests from the frontend to the backend, ensuring smooth communication between the two.

### API Routes

- **/api/books**: Handles requests related to books (e.g., fetching all books, adding a new book).
- **/api/orders**: Manages order-related functionalities (e.g., creating, updating, and retrieving orders).
- **/api/auth**: Manages user authentication (e.g., login, registration, token verification).
- **/api/admin**: Provides admin functionalities (e.g., managing users, books, and orders).
